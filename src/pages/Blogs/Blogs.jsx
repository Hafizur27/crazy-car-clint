          1. What is an access token and refresh token? <br /> How do they work
          and where should we store them on the client-side?
        </h3>
        <p>
          An access token is a credential that is issued by an authentication
          server upon successful authentication of a user or application. It
          grants temporary authorization to access specific resources or perform
          certain actions on behalf of the authenticated user. Access tokens are
          typically used in API authentication to validate and authorize
          requests. A refresh token, on the other hand, is a long-lived
          credential that is also issued during the authentication process. Its
          purpose is to obtain a new access token once the current one expires.
          Refresh tokens are used to maintain persistent authentication without
          requiring the user to re-enter their credentials every time an access
          token expires. They provide a more secure and seamless way to manage
          access to protected resources. <br />
          When a user or application successfully authenticates with a server
          and receives an access token and refresh token, the tokens are
          typically stored on the client-side for subsequent use in API
          requests. <br />
          When a user or application successfully authenticates with a server
          and receives an access token and refresh token, the tokens are
          typically stored on the client-side for subsequent use in API
          requests. The access token is typically sent in the Authorization
          header of API requests to authenticate and authorize the client. The
          server validates the access token to ensure the client has the
          necessary permissions to access the requested resource. Access tokens
          have a limited lifespan, known as the token is expiration time. Once
          the access token expires, the client needs to obtain a new one. <br />
          This is where the refresh token comes into play. The refresh token is
          securely stored on the client-side, usually in a secure HTTP-only
          cookie or a local storage mechanism. When the access token expires,
          the client sends the refresh token to the server in a token refresh
          request. The server verifies the refresh token and, if valid, issues a
          new access token to the client. This process allows the client to
          maintain continuous access to protected resources without requiring
          the user to re-authenticate. <br />
          It is important to handle and store tokens securely on the
          client-side. Storing tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies provides
          additional protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
          Alternatively, tokens can be stored in a secure storage mechanism like
          local storage or session storage, but precautions must be taken to
          prevent access by malicious scripts or unauthorized parties. It is
          recommended to follow security best practices and implement measures
          such as token encryption, token rotation, and usage of secure storage
          mechanisms to protect access tokens and refresh tokens on the
          client-side.

          2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
        </h3>
        <p>
          SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad
          categories of database management systems that differ in their data
          models, query languages, and design principles. Here is a comparison
          between the two: <br /> <span className="font-bold">Data Model:</span>{" "}
          <br />
          SQL databases use a rigid, tabular, and predefined schema to organize
          and store data. Data is structured into tables with fixed columns and
          rows, and relationships between tables are established using primary
          and foreign keys. <br />
          <br /> NoSQL databases offer a more flexible data model. They can be
          document-based (like MongoDB), key-value stores (like Redis),
          column-oriented (like Cassandra), or graph databases (like Neo4j).
          NoSQL databases allow for dynamic and schema-less data structures,
          making them suitable for handling unstructured or rapidly evolving
          data. <br /> <span className="font-bold">
            Scalability:
          </span> <br /> SQL databases typically follow a vertical scaling
          approach, where resources are increased on a single server (such as
          upgrading CPU or memory) to handle increased load. This can be
          limiting in terms of scalability. <br /> <br />
          NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling, meaning they can
          distribute data across multiple servers or clusters. They excel at
          handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads, making them
          highly scalable. <br />{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">Query Language:</span> <br />
          SQL databases use the SQL query language, which is a standard language
          for managing relational databases. SQL offers powerful querying
          capabilities and supports complex joins, aggregations, and
          transactions. <br />
          <br />
          NoSQL databases have varying query languages depending on the specific
          database type. Some NoSQL databases use a query language similar to
          SQL, while others use APIs or custom query languages specific to their
          data model. NoSQL databases often prioritize simple read/write
          operations over complex querying. <br />{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">Flexibility and Agility:</span>
          <br />
          SQL databases have a fixed schema, requiring predefined table
          structures. Adding new columns or altering the schema can be
          cumbersome and may require downtime or complex migration procedures.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          NoSQL databases provide schema flexibility and can adapt to changing
          data requirements more easily. They allow for dynamic schema updates,
          making them more suitable for agile development and handling evolving
          data structures.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, a
          JavaScript runtime environment. It provides a minimal and flexible set
          of tools for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies
          the process of creating server-side applications by providing a thin
          layer of features built on top of Node.js. It offers a range of
          functionality, including routing, middleware support, handling HTTP
          requests and responses, and rendering views. Express.js is known for
          its simplicity and ease of use, allowing developers to quickly set up
          robust web servers. <br /> <br />
          NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient,
          scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It is designed to
          enhance productivity and enable the creation of robust and modular
          applications using TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript.

          4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In MongoDB, the aggregate method is a powerful tool used for
          performing complex data processing and analysis on collections. It
          allows you to perform various transformations, aggregations, and
          computations on the documents in a collection. <br />
          The aggregate method accepts an array of stages that define the
          processing pipeline. Each stage represents an operation or
          transformation that is applied to the documents as they pass through
          the pipeline. Here is an overview of the key concepts and stages used
          in the MongoDB aggregation framework: <br />
          Match: This stage filters the documents in the collection based on
          specified criteria using query operators. It works similar to the find
          method but within the aggregation pipeline. <br />
          Project: The project stage allows you to shape the output documents by
          specifying the fields to include or exclude. You can rename fields,
          create computed fields, and reshape the structure of the documents.{" "}
          <br />
          Group: The group stage groups documents by a specified key and applies
          various aggregation operations to the grouped data. Common operations
          include sum, average, count, minimum, maximum, and more. It enables
          you to perform calculations across multiple documents. <br />
          Sort: The sort stage orders the documents in the pipeline based on
          specified sort criteria. You can sort by one or multiple fields, in
          ascending or descending order. <br />
          Limit and Skip: These stages allow you to limit the number of
          documents returned in the result set (limit) and skip a specified
          number of documents (skip). They are useful for pagination and
          controlling the size of the result set. <br /> <br />
          Lookup: The lookup stage performs a left outer join between two
          collections and combines matching documents based on a specified
          condition. It is useful for retrieving related data from multiple
          collections. <br />
          Unwind: The unwind stage deconstructs an array field in the documents,
          creating a separate document for each element of the array. This is
          helpful when you want to work with individual array elements in
          subsequent pipeline stages.
